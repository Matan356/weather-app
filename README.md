I built the server in three layers:
services, routing, controllers

The routing handles the handling of requests and referrals to the controllers.

The controller handles reviewing their test and performing verifications. A move is made to the services that manage the request.

The Services only deal with the interaction of receiving the information.

I built the front
On several levels
components - responsible for all elements of the components

context - responsible for the context files

hooks - which are responsible for all custom hooks

Page - folder responsible for all complex components
